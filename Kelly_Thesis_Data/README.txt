Scripts for running OpenMC on Lehmi (Openmc.pbs) or SCALE on Sawtooth (run.pbs).
-they need to use the unix end of line character (so either edit in VIM or use notepad++ to convert if it doesn't work with a direct upload)
-each cores memory is actually fairly limited, so if a memory error is seen it may be resolved by reducing the number of mpiprocs while
 requesting the same amount of nodes. Make sure when requesting less mpiprocs, your total number procs in the scale command line is mpiprocs*nodes.
 This is typically encountered during depletion runs or with large mesh sizes (>100x100x100 or so)

MSRdepl.py
Example for running a depletion simulation on Lehmi.

TwoTermExpSolver.ipy
Used to solve for the min. poly shielding based on the equation in Table 3.3 based on the mesh flux values from OpenMC

Data Processing.ipy
Charged particle transport through the detector
Relies on txt files generated from the region tally outputs from SCALE - see "pastLi.txt" - RT1 MT=27 data,
"pastphoton.txt" - RT2 MT=501 data, "pastabs.txt" - RT3 MT=27 (in SIC volume) data
These were generated by just copying the group data from the response function into a separate text file so that it could be put in a dataframe

polyflux20.txt
Used for generating flux profile in Data Processing

OpenMC_MSR.ipynb
Base file for running depletion and k-eff simulations. Includes a few random methods for data visualization and processing.

depletion_results.h5
random depletion results

statepoint.100 (4).h5
random k-eff sim results, probably has at least the normal flux tally

chain_mod_q.xml
modified q values to match SCALE via J. Faulkner

Cf/fuel/RPV/NS decay
Decayed in Origen after burnup at 30 and 180 days for import to MAVRIC
Results are the varied .f71 files. the "0" f71 file is the output from a Triton simulation

MSRsimple
Keno for generating fission source

MSRstartup
Keno for generating fission source

MSRmavric
base full power for area fluxes

MSRorigen
Activation of a material

Detector99
Detector at 99cm, same file was modified to adjust shielding, size, and distance geometry.
Note the bounding box for the importance map needed to be updated correspondingly

MSRdepletion and associated files
depletion in SCALE

depletedfluxes/30
base post-burn core (activated fuel RPV and NS) source range configuration for area fluxes

depeltedshielded20b4cVOL
detector version of the above for the large B4C shield test case
